# Whiteboard Hub

I want you to modify something without changing the design oof the app because I like it:

- If I'm done writing or editing in the text or sticky notes and I clicked outside of the box where I'm writing, the text I wrote/modified should be saved.

- I like the selection box but adjust it with the text item, when I want to resize the box, the text gets resized as well.

- sometimes when I want to change the phont or the size of the text in either the sticky note or text box I can't see what I'm writing because the setting menu is covering what I'm seeing so I can't see changes, fix that and make it suitable.

- make the cursor of the vanishing pen the size size as the pen cursor without changing the look.

- there's a bug, when I choose the arrow tool and then I choose emoji tool the ouse gets back to the arrow, fix that.

- the ruler in the tools should be useful, so if the pen can make straight lines just like microsoft whietboard feature, fix that.

- if I added a sticky note to the whiteboard it's fine its stays blank, but I just want the sticky notes to have like a shadow desgin just make it modern.

- I mentioned this in the previous chat " ONLY if the black background is selected then the white color should be the default color on the pen tool " so as I said, only in the dark theme background and switch to the default color for the pen if I changed the theme of the whiteboard/background to dark/black mode.

- in layers section, I want to have the option to name my whiteboards.

- adjust the dark glass theme in the menu and change its name to dark theme and fix its bugs and problems.

- in the setting, remove "auto-edit after creation" but keep it when I select a sticky note.

- remove laser animation from setting only.

- I didn't like the animation of " burning ember" so make it better.

 

 

-and I want to Add a Home/Dashboard system to my existing whiteboard application.

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT redesign or modify the existing whiteboard editor UI, toolbar, tools, canvas behavior, or styling. Keep the existing whiteboard exactly as it is. Only add the following functionality.

HOME / DASHBOARD FEATURES:

1. HOME PAGE

- Create a separate Home/Dashboard view for the application.

- When the user is inside a whiteboard and clicks the Home button, return to the Home/Dashboard.

- Do NOT reload the entire application unnecessarily.

- The current whiteboard must be automatically saved before returning Home.

2. NEW WHITEBOARD

- Add a "New Whiteboard" action.

- Clicking it creates a completely new empty whiteboard.

- Give the new whiteboard a unique ID.

- Give it a default name such as "Untitled Whiteboard".

- Open the newly created whiteboard immediately in the existing editor.

- Do not overwrite or delete any existing whiteboards.

3. SAVED WHITEBOARDS

- The Home page must display all previously created/saved whiteboards.

- Every whiteboard must be stored independently.

- Each whiteboard should have:

  - unique ID

  - title

  - creation date

  - last modified date

  - all canvas elements

  - camera position

  - zoom level

  - grid settings

  - any other existing whiteboard state that needs to be restored

4. OPEN WHITEBOARD

- Clicking an existing whiteboard opens that exact whiteboard in the existing editor.

- Restore everything exactly as it was:

  - drawings

  - text

  - shapes

  - sticky notes

  - images

  - emojis

  - lines/arrows

  - positions

  - sizes

  - rotations

  - colors

  - locked state

  - camera position

  - zoom

  - grid

- The user should continue exactly where they left off.

5. AUTO-SAVE

- Automatically save changes to the currently opened whiteboard.

- Do not use a single global "current" board anymore.

- Each whiteboard must have its own persistent storage record.

- Saving one board must never overwrite another board.

- Use IndexedDB for persistent local storage.

- Debounce frequent saves so drawing does not cause excessive database writes.

6. RENAME WHITEBOARD

- Allow the user to rename an existing whiteboard.

- The new name must be saved automatically.

- The name shown on Home must match the name inside the editor.

7. DELETE WHITEBOARD

- Allow the user to delete a whiteboard from the Home page.

- Ask for confirmation before permanently deleting it.

- Deleting one whiteboard must not affect any other whiteboard.

- If the deleted whiteboard is currently open, safely return to Home.

8. DUPLICATE WHITEBOARD

- Allow the user to duplicate an existing whiteboard.

- Create a new unique ID for the duplicate.

- Copy all elements and settings.

- Give the duplicate a different title, for example:

  "Original Name Copy"

- Changes to the duplicate must not affect the original.

9. RECENTLY MODIFIED

- Store the last modified timestamp.

- Sort or display whiteboards by most recently modified.

- Opening or editing a board should update its last modified time.

10. THUMBNAILS

- Generate a thumbnail/preview of each whiteboard.

- The thumbnail should represent the actual contents of that whiteboard.

- Update the thumbnail when the whiteboard changes.

- Do not store unnecessarily huge thumbnail images; optimize them for local storage.

11. HOME BUTTON BEHAVIOR

Inside the whiteboard editor:

Home button clicked

→ save current whiteboard

→ close/leave current editor state

→ open Home/Dashboard

Home button must NOT:

- delete the board

- create a new board

- reset the board

- overwrite another board

12. BROWSER REFRESH

- If the user refreshes while editing a whiteboard, restore the same whiteboard.

- If the user closes and reopens the HTML application, all saved whiteboards must still exist.

- Do not rely only on JavaScript variables or localStorage for the actual board data; use IndexedDB.

13. URL / STATE

If practical, use a simple application state such as:

Home:

#home

Whiteboard:

#board/<board-id>

This allows the application to know which whiteboard is currently open.

14. DATA ARCHITECTURE

Replace the current single-board storage approach.

Instead of:

IndexedDB

└── current

    └── one whiteboard

Use:

IndexedDB

└── boards

    ├── board-id-1

    ├── board-id-2

    ├── board-id-3

    └── ...

Each board must be completely independent.

15. IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT

My existing whiteboard already has working features.

Do NOT rewrite the whiteboard from scratch.

Integrate the Home/Dashboard system into the existing code.

Preserve all existing:

- drawing tools

- pen

- highlighter

- eraser

- vanishing pen

- text

- shapes

- arrows

- lines

- sticky notes

- emojis

- images

- selection

- resizing

- rotation

- undo/redo

- keyboard shortcuts

- minimap

- grid

- zoom

- pan

- autosave

- export

- existing toolbar

- existing styling

16. MIGRATION

The current application may already have an existing saved whiteboard using a single "current" IndexedDB record.

Do not lose that data.

When the application is updated:

- detect the old "current" board

- automatically migrate it into the new multi-board system

- give it a default name such as "My Whiteboard"

- preserve all of its elements and settings

- only perform the migration once

17. ERROR HANDLING

- If a board cannot be loaded, do not crash the entire application.

- If saving fails, show a save error/status.

- If IndexedDB is unavailable, handle the error gracefully.

- Never silently delete whiteboard data.

18. PERFORMANCE

- Do not save on every mousemove/pointermove.

- Use debounced autosaving.

- Do not regenerate expensive thumbnails unnecessarily.

- Keep the existing drawing performance smooth.

FINAL REQUIREMENT:

Implement this as a proper multi-whiteboard application architecture while keeping my existing whiteboard editor unchanged.

The final result should behave like:

HOME

↓

New Whiteboard

↓

WHITEBOARD EDITOR

↓

Home

↓

HOME

or:

HOME

↓

Existing Whiteboard

↓

WHITEBOARD EDITOR

Multiple whiteboards must be able to exist simultaneously and independently.
